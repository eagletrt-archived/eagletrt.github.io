torsional stiffness compared to the mass has been chosen as the basis for the following optimization
process.

Performance Evaluation

  • Modal Analysis
  • Transient Analysis on circuit

Transient Analysis on Circuit
*****************************

The trajectory plotted below is calculated to avoid the wheel slip with the highest possible speed. To find
the ideal path and the corresponding accelerations, a Matlab code has been developed. The data relating
to the accelerations and therefore the forces acting on the structure were transferred into the Ansys APDL
car model.

  * Track Limits: Green

Loads on Tires
**************

To understand how the total structure is stressed the load history must be known. The starting point are the
reaction forces that the car receives from the ground through the wheels.
The plot below represents the tires reaction forces during the skid pad test. The weight car force was
considered in the dynamic load transfer.
Vertical loads results:

.. figure:: /images/designChassisgrafico

Grip limit values found during the tire analysis model:

  • 1700 [N] for the front wheels
  • 3800 [N] for the rear wheels.

Observing the lateral loads results can be seen that the rear wheels in the points of higher acceleration slip.
In fact, the springs that simulate the wheels give a reaction force higher than the real grip condition. This can
lead to have a peaks load on the structure higher to the actual ones.

Stress analysis
***************

.. figure:: /images/designChassisgrafico

The stresses peaks occur during trajectory change. This happens when the machine moves from one circle to
the other during the skid pad test.

Chassis Torsion
***************

To find the chassis torsion in Ansys, has been calculated the difference between the front and rear rotation
of the axes with respect to the roll center.

.. figure:: /images/designChassisgrafico

As can be seen from the chart above, the chassis behaves like a torsional spring due to the weight distribution
difference. The advantage of having such small deformations is that at each elastic return of the chassis in
the curve exit, there are less oscillations, resulting in a better drivability

Additive Manufacturing Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The idea of 3D printed joints
*****************************

Once the X, Y, Z coordinates of the kinematic points have been defined, is mandatory to maintain the
maximum precision after the welding. Adding the brackets “by hand” using a complex support structure is
expensive, less precise and incline to misalignments and errors.

The possibility given by additive manufacturing allows to overcome many of those problems. The final
version of the joints has unique features:
  * Integrated suspension brackets

  * Topology optimized with internal ribs and variable thickness

  * Nesting guides for precise assembly, torque transmission, easier welding process

  * Allowing better electrical grounding across the entire structure

  * Head-to-head welding with tubes due to 4 spacers for each terminal

Conclusion
**********

In the first and the second plot the lines are essentially overlapped. This proves the validity of the Ansys
model. In the central zone of the curves, that corresponds to the work range, the lines are the basically the
same. The only difference can be seen in the final parts when the antiroll stiffness rear is low. This low value
generates a non-linearity in the Ansys model not expected in Matlab.
This non-linearity can be observed in the plot of the structure torsion in respect with the front antiroll
distribution stiffness:

.. figure:: /images/designChassisgrafico

An assumption done in the Matlab analytical model is that the torsional stiffness of the structure is linear.
On the other hand, as can be seen from the above plot the structure behaviour coming from the Ansys model
it isn’t linear changing the front antiroll distribution stiffness. While calculating the stiffness of the structure
with shock absorbers infinitely rigid the stiffness response is linear.

Analysis before and after joints integration.
With the same loads and constraints applied, torsional stiffness has been increased by almost a factor of 3

Manufacturing Process
+++++++++++++++++++++

The addition of joints allows a much easier assembly and welding process, the structure can support itself
without requiring a complex tooling structure.
Weld bead is simpler and with more controlled thermal distribution.
Tubes laser cutting in easier, with less waste material.
